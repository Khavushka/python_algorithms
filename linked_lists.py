# Linked lists (traverse, search, add, delete, header, nodes, tail)
'''
A linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is 
not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, 
each element points to the next. It's a data structure consisting of 
a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.

In its most basic form, each node contains: data, and a reference
(in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence. 

This structure allows for efficicent insertion or removal of elements 
from any position in the sequence during iteration. 

More complex variants add additional links, allowing more efficient
insertion or removal of nodes at arbitrary positions.

A drawback of linked lists is that access time is linear (and difficult to pipeline)
