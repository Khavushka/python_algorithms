# Dynamic Programming

'''
Python  is strongly typed as the interpreter keeps
track of all variables types. Its's also very dymanic as it rarely
uses what it knows to limit variable usage
- breaking the problem down
- solving recursively (рекурсивно)
- optimal solutions to construct optimal solutions

In dynamic progaramming there are three basic methods:
- recursion
- top-down(w/memorization)
- bottom-up(w/tabulation)
